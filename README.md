# OSINT + Cryptography Challenges
Welcome to the Github repository for OSINT + Cryptography Challenges. The aim of this repository is to provide help in solving the challenges published [here](https://www.shrutipriya.in/challenges/challenges-introduction). 
Each file is tied to a particular challenge, e.g. `challenge_3.py` is tied to OSINT + Cryptography #3.
</br>
</br>
Furthermore, the code itself contains exhaustive comments to guide beginners in understanding the code functionality. 
</br>
</br>
_**Note:** This repository only serves as a guide. The challenges can also be solved through open source intelligence without the given code. Some challenges might be tied to custom web pages (html files) on this repository. Refer to the specific challenge for more information._
